# 3D-Art-Gallary

This is a 3D interactive art gallery that offers users a unique and engaging experience. In this immersive environment, users navigate a game-like third-person view where they have full control over a player character. The player can approach any art painting within the gallery, triggering a pop-up window that provides detailed information about the selected artwork.

Explore the virtual art gallery, get up close to exquisite art pieces, and dive into the stories behind each creation. This interactive platform bridges the gap between art and technology, offering an interactive journey through the world of fine art.
